# 1. Overview
Welcome to the app Fitness Helper! 
A common trend that I found upon those around me is that there seems to be a severe lack of commimentment regarding exercise, when the individual wishes to actively participate in it. The reasoning behind their struggle can vary whether it just be an actual lack of dedication or having the issue of knowing what to actually do when starting out. With this app, I aspire to solve both of these issues by providing a easily accessible database of exercise that target different areas of the body and are further divided into separate divisions in regards to their difficulty. Overall, the purpose of this app is provide users with an easy way of accessing and finding exercises that fit their level of experience and build up towards the more difficult exercises. 

# 2. App Description
In this app, users can easily navigate through the numerous amount of exercises that target they specific area that seek to work out on. Within each targeted area, exercises are split into three divsions: easy, moderate, and difficult to enable users of all experience levels to be capable of trying exercises that fit their skill level. Each exercises within each difficult level contains the suggested amount of repetitions or minutes that should be attempted.
